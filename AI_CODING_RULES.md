# 🧠 AI_CODING_RULES.md

## Purpose
These are the strict collaboration rules for AI-assisted development (Amazon Q, ChatGPT, or other AI agents).
They ensure consistency, safety, context awareness, and structural integrity across the NeoCred codebase.

## 🏗️ 1. General Behavior

**Never assume context is empty.**
Always check the existing folder and file structure before creating or editing any file.

**Respect the established architecture.**
Follow the folder layout, naming conventions, and component hierarchy already present in the project.

**Do not overwrite or delete existing logic unless explicitly instructed** ("Replace entire file").

**When updating code, make incremental changes only** — preserve comments, formatting, and previous imports.

**Never create duplicate files** (e.g., auth_new.tsx if auth.tsx already exists).

**Follow existing style** (indentation, naming, Tailwind design, etc.) — ensure a uniform code aesthetic.

**CRITICAL: When asked to "fix errors" - ONLY fix the specific errors, do NOT remove or rewrite existing code.**

**CRITICAL: Follow the instruction "Just fix it. Don't edit or update or rewrite the code. Follow the AI_CODING_RULES.md" - make minimal targeted fixes only.**

## 📂 2. File Creation Rules

**Before creating a file:**
- Scan the repository (or ask the user) if that file already exists.
- If yes → update or append only, not recreate.

**File names must match the ones specified by the user exactly.**
Example: If the user says "create file auth.tsx", don't name it authpage.tsx.

**Always confirm file path and purpose before generating content.**

**When creating a file, include:**
- Brief top-level comment (// Purpose:) describing its role.
- Proper imports for project consistency.
- Correct export type (default or named).

## 🧩 3. Code Update Rules

**Before modifying any file, read its existing content.**

**Preserve:**
- Comments
- Constants
- Type definitions
- Functions not related to the requested change

**Never clear or rewrite the whole file unless the user says:**
"Replace the entire file."

**When adding a feature:**
- Inject only into the relevant section (function, component, route).
- Maintain logical flow and avoid breaking existing code.
- Add comments around major new blocks for clarity, e.g.:
```javascript
// 🔧 Added by AI: OAuth Google login handler (v2)
```

## 🔁 4. Context & Memory Handling

**Always preserve long-term architectural consistency** — even if the chat history is cleared.

**Reference previously established design standards** (UI/UX, backend schema, naming conventions).

**When starting a new chat, summarize existing structure before creating or editing anything.**

**If unsure about context, ask before acting.**

## ⚙️ 5. Consistency Rules

**Keep naming patterns consistent:**
- Components: PascalCase
- Functions/hooks: camelCase
- Files: kebab-case or snake_case (based on repo convention)

**Always match existing UI design system** (colors, typography, Tailwind utility patterns).

**Maintain consistent imports** — use relative paths like "@/components/ui/button" instead of "../../../".

**Follow existing API route style** (REST or GraphQL, depending on project).

**Reuse existing helpers, constants, and context providers whenever possible.**

## 🔐 6. Safety & Security

**Do not include any real API keys, secrets, or tokens in generated code.**

**Use environment variables (process.env) for all credentials.**

**Never log sensitive data** (passwords, tokens, PII) to console or responses.

**When handling auth or sensitive logic** → always validate input and sanitize output.

## 🧠 7. Communication Protocol

**Always confirm intent before performing destructive actions** (file deletion, refactor, rename).

**If the user's request is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions.**

**Provide short summaries before applying large code changes.**

**Include a "diff-style" summary of what was changed when editing existing files.**

## 🧪 8. Testing & Validation

**After code generation, ensure imports resolve correctly.**

**Always check for syntax and type errors before finalizing.**

**If applicable, include a small example/test case for new functions.**

**Verify that updated components render correctly and preserve state.**

## 🚀 9. When Chat History Is Cleared

**Always ask the user:**
"Would you like me to load your existing project context first?"

**Then rebuild context from the file structure** (/components, /pages, /lib, etc.) before generating new code.

**Never generate files blindly in a fresh session without confirming architecture.**

## 🧰 10. Optional Enhancements

**Include version tags in comments, e.g.**
```javascript
// Version: NeoCred Auth v1.4 — Updated Google/Apple login handler
```

**Maintain a CHANGELOG.md for all AI-generated updates.**

**When creating config or environment files, mark them clearly:**
```bash
# Generated by Amazon Q (do not commit secrets)
```

## ✅ Summary

**"Always respect structure, context, and naming.
Never overwrite without permission.
Ask before assuming.
Write code that integrates — not isolates."**
