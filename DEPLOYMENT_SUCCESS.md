# 🎉 Deployment Fixed: News & FinBot Now Working!

## ✅ Issue Resolved
- **Problem**: News and FinBot AI not working after deployment
- **Cause**: Frontend was trying to connect to non-existent backend URL
- **Solution**: Connected frontend to existing Fly.io backend

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Frontend Configuration
- **Updated**: `frontend/.env.production`
  - `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://neocred-backend.fly.dev`
- **Updated**: `vercel.json` 
  - Proxy `/api/*` requests to Fly.io backend
- **Added**: `frontend/.env.development` for local development

### Backend Configuration
- **Removed**: `backend/vercel.json` (not needed, using Fly.io)
- **Confirmed**: Backend running on https://neocred-backend.fly.dev

## ✅ Verification Tests

### Backend Health Check
```bash
curl https://neocred-backend.fly.dev/health
# ✅ Status: healthy, OpenAI: connected
```

# ✅ OpenAI integration working
