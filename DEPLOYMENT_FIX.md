# üö® Deployment Fix: News & FinBot Not Working

## Issue Identified
After deployment, News and FinBot AI are not working because:
1. Production environment points to `https://neocred.in` for API calls
2. No backend server is deployed at that URL
3. Frontend is trying to connect to non-existent backend

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Deploy Backend to Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Deploy backend separately
cd backend
vercel --prod

# Update frontend .env.production with deployed backend URL
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.vercel.app
```

### Option 2: Use Local Backend for Testing
```bash
# Start backend locally
cd backend
python main_simple.py

# Frontend will connect to localhost:8001
# This works for local testing but not for production users
```

### Option 3: Deploy Full-Stack to Vercel
```bash
# Update main vercel.json to handle both frontend and backend
# Configure API routes to proxy to backend functions
```

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Frontend deployed successfully
- ‚ùå Backend not deployed
- ‚ùå API calls failing (News & FinBot)

## Immediate Action Required
1. Deploy backend to Vercel or another platform
2. Update VITE_API_BASE_URL in production environment
3. Redeploy frontend with correct API URL

## Files Updated
- `backend/vercel.json` - Backend deployment config
- `backend/requirements.txt` - Updated dependencies
- `frontend/.env.production` - Temporarily set to localhost

## Next Steps
1. Deploy backend: `cd backend && vercel --prod`
2. Update API URL in production environment
3. Redeploy frontend
4. Test News and FinBot functionality
