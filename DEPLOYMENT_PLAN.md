# Safe Deployment Plan

## Current Status ✅
- Build: **SUCCESSFUL** 
- Branch: `fix-jsx-errors` (safe, not main)
- Backup: `backup-before-fixes` tag created
- Changes: 64 files deleted + 5 files modified

## Deployment Strategy

### Option 1: Gradual Deployment (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Test locally first** - Run `npm run dev` and verify all features
2. **Create staging branch** - Deploy to test environment
3. **Merge to main** only after thorough testing

### Option 2: Direct Deployment (RISKY)
- Push current changes directly to production
- ⚠️ **Risk**: Live website could break if hosting detects issues

## Safety Measures in Place
- ✅ Backup tag created
- ✅ Working on separate branch
- ✅ Build passes successfully
- ✅ Only minor warnings (not errors)

## Rollback Plan
If deployment fails:
```bash
git checkout backup-before-fixes
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## Recommendation
**Test locally first**, then deploy gradually to minimize risk to live website.
