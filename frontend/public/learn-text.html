        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Master money management, wealth building, and financial independence through comprehensive personal finance strategies.</p>
        
        <h4>Section 1: Introduction</h4>
        <p>Personal finance refers to the management of an individual's or household's financial activities, including earning, saving, investing, budgeting, spending, and protecting money. It encompasses short-term decisions such as managing daily expenses, as well as long-term strategies such as retirement planning, wealth building, and intergenerational financial security. Personal finance is a critical life skill that influences financial independence, stability, and well-being in today's rapidly evolving economic landscape.</p>
        
        <h4>Section 2: Core Components</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Income Management:</strong> Primary income (salary), passive income (dividends, rental), side income (freelancing), portfolio income (capital gains)</li>
            <li><strong>Budgeting & Expense Management:</strong> 50/30/20 rule (50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings), zero-based budgeting, envelope system</li>
            <li><strong>Saving & Emergency Planning:</strong> 6-month emergency fund, high-yield savings (7-8% rates in 2025), liquid funds</li>

        <p><strong>CIBIL Score Ranges:</strong> 750-900 Excellent, 700-749 Good, 650-699 Fair, 300-649 Poor</p>
        <p><strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Manage debt wisely - prioritize high-interest debt repayment. Maintain CIBIL score above 750 for best loan rates.</p>
